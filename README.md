# Mission-to-Mars
The purpose of this project is to build a web scrapper across different websites looking at various sets of mars data. This data includes articles, pictures, and tables. It is scraped using python and stored in mongo database. The data is then displayed in its own website that includes the ability to update scrapes for newest data.
